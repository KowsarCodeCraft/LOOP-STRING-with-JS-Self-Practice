    <h1>Self Practice: JS LOOP AND STRING</h1>
    <h2><u>for Loop</u></h2>
    <p>Loop used inside the JS to see the things repeatdly by coding</p>
    <pre><u>Formation of Loop :</u> 
      for(let i=0; i<= array.length; i++)
      {
         console.log("Variable")
      }
    
    </pre>
    <p>Here Let is veriable and under this veriable we are using 3 statement</p>
    <p>
      First , i, indicate initial variable statement. So you can put any name as
      per your need
    </p>

    <p>second, i, indicate stopping condition statement</p>
    <p>
      Third, i, indicate updatation statement means it will continue and
      <br />based on the second condition statement it will run untill given
      condition value
    </p>

    <h2><u>while loop</u></h2>
    <p>
      This loop works almost similar like for loop. Whatever we can do by for
      loop, we can do the same things by while loop too. Just difference is we
      can write the code in different formation
    </p>
    <p><u>Formation of Loop :</u> while(condition){...do your code...}</p>

    <h2><u>do-while loop</u></h2>
    <p>
      this bascially oppositie of while loop. here we do the code/print first
      then put the condition <br />
      and there will be a semicolon(;) after the condition in do-while loop. But
      for while loop this is not needed
    </p>
    <p><u>Formation of Loop :</u> do{ console.log("variable")} while(condition);</p>

    <h5>
      Note : infinite loop- make sure we will not use infinite loop in coding
      otherwsie system might get crush if value is showing always tru. So we
      have to difine in condtion which will have some limition of stopping
